# HW-todo-api

Submit your To-Do-API here. In your readme describe the application and any additions you made. Please link to the source of the API. If you have a git repo for this project on your own account also link to it here (as it would document the dif's between what you wrote and what was given to you)

For this web application, a todo list is created, then items can be updated, and/or deleted from the list. We will use AWS Beanstalk and Jenkins to deploy the todo app.

For this homework, we were given the resource from [stack abuse](https://stackabuse.com/building-a-todo-app-with-flask-in-python/). I ran into some issues using ***sqlite3*** database that I was not able to troubleshoot.

So, I used a different open source code from [Python-Engineer](https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/) website.
In this resource, the author used [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy).

I did not use the CSS file from the source.

For the set up documentation, see [link](https://github.com/ibrahima1289/DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP/blob/main/Dplymnt4_apps_IDiallo.pdf).
