# HW-todo-api

For this web application, a todo list is created, then items can be updated, and/or deleted from the list. We will use AWS Beanstalk and Jenkins to deploy the todo app.

For this homework, we were given the resource from [stack abuse](https://stackabuse.com/building-a-todo-app-with-flask-in-python/). I ran into some issues using ***sqlite3*** database that I was not able to troubleshoot.

So, I used a different open source code from [Python-Engineer](https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/) website.
In this resource, the author used [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy).

I did not use the CSS file from the source.

For the set up documentation, see [link](https://github.com/ibrahima1289/DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP/blob/main/Dplymnt4_apps_IDiallo.pdf).
