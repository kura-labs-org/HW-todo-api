# HW-todo-api
The goal here is to deploy a flask app that connects to a database and use HTTP Methods to make changes and updates to a database.


We're using the following:
Vscode
Python - flask, json
Postman - for substituting curl if using Windows.

For EBS deployment
we needed to change line 5 in the code and the name of the application.py to correspond with name of the file/application that is being deployed. We also needed to add a requirements.txt to make it functional
