# HW-To Do-api

This app will keep track of tasks and their completion status. I didn't make any functional changes from the original guide.
The files in the repo include `main.py` which runs the Flask app. It also includes `helper.py` which contains all the functions `main.py` runs on its various routes.
`Requirements.txt` includes modules required for installation to run the Flask app successfully.
