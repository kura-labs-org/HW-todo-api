# HW-todo-api

# Description
Using Flask to develop a Python based web application that connects to a SQLite Database and communicates with the web server through a seies of HTTP requests. Items can be added, returned, updated and deleted from the ToDoList.

# My addition
I thought adding a "due date" associated with each ToDo item would be beneficial for staying organized.
